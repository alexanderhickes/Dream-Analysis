			Dream conversation 1: Standard

Therapist:	Hello there! Come on in.
User:		Hi
Therapist:	Lets begin by getting your name.
User:		My name is Sam
Therapist:	Pleasure to meet you Sam!
Therapist:	How about we start by getting to jist of your dream?
User:		I was cycling around Brighton. A red car started chasing me. It hit me. A man got out. It turned out to be my father.
Therapist:	Thats good
Therapist:	Can you tell me how the father made you feel?
User:		our current relationship is not great
Therapist:	I see.
Therapist:	Is there anything else you would like to tell me about this dream?
User:		It was dark when this happened
Therapist:	Excellent
Therapist:	Well, it seems like I have enough information to interpret this dream. Before we do that, would you like to 'get analysis' or provide a 'new dream'?
User:		get analysis
Therapist:	From what I can see, you have some underlying issues you should be aware of. Your dream references the Psyche, Oedipus Complex in a negative way. Red signifies your feelings, according to Carl Jung (1930). Father figures for males are associated with envy. Perhaps you have some unresolved family conflict. It maybe worth looking further into Freud's ideas on the Oedipus Complex, Psyche.

Therapist:	Before I give you an analysis, Is there anything else you would like to tell me about this dream?
User:		not really
Therapist:	Well, it seems like I have enough information to interpret these dreams for you. Your first dream shows the death in a very negative context. Taking a trip shows a willingness for death. Storms show conflict in the unconscious. The second dream shows the death in a very negative context. Taking a trip shows a willingness for death. If a mother figure appears in your dream, this generally refers to a sexual symbolism. Father figures for males are associated with envy. Perhaps you have some unresolved family conflict. Both dreams share the symbolism of the Oedipus Complex, Psyche. They both show them in a very negative context. Look into Freud's dream symbolism for more information.

Therapist:	Before I give you an analysis, Is there anything else you would like to tell me about this dream?

House represent the body. smooth, featureless buildings and male whilst featurfull ones with clingable objects are female. The colour black is associated to our uncoincious mind, according to Carl Jung (1930). The second dreams shows. Mountains represent peaks. Its likely that you have overcome a major milestone if you end up on  top of a mountain. The dreams provided have nothing in common. Maybe try some different dreams and see what comes up.
